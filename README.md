# Board Game Web Catalog

If you run some public place (e.g restaurant, community center) with board game collection, you can use this app for automatic management and presentation of your games.

## How does it work?

1. Export your collection (list of game names) from Excel to CSV file
2. Load CSV in Administration and run magic Loader that will find your games on BoardGameGeek.com and complete all information of these games automatically
3. Publish your collection so clients/visitors could see it
4. There is also advanced search and filtering by different parameters

Demo is available [here](https://board-game-web-catalog.vercel.app/) (hosted by Vercel).
